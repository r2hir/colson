Hello, this project was created as a coding exercise by an 18-year-old beginner programmer, and a lot of comments have been put in the program so that the concept of the codes are more understandable. If you have any suggestions or errors, please email me.

This code does not require anything special and only requires pre-installed Python libraries. The database used in this program is Sqlite.

Get it and run it, that easy :)
